# Architectural Exploration of Graph Neural Networks for Job Shop Scheduling: A Makespan Prediction Approach

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to design and evaluate various Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures for their effectiveness in predicting the makespan of Job Shop Scheduling (JSS) instances. This research seeks to identify which GNN configurations are most conducive to model effectively JSS problems.
